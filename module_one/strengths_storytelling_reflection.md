# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection 

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes: How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?

*   I realized that I do tie closely to my strengths. Futuristic and achiever were my top two and I found myself getting nervous and impatient throught this first module due to my seemingly slow speed to retain the information. As I grew more confident I started seeing myself more as a prospective developer rather than a struggling student. 
  I do see some of my strengths as possible weaknesses to do my happiness being set on achieving goals and seeing myself as a professional developer. I would kind of lose sight on the process of learning the information and setting smaller, realistic goals for myself to help retain my confidence in this process.

* Write a story about your Turing experience so far: When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?
* I have struggled with my understanding and implementation of JS. I also struggled with doing the smaller things, due to my tunnel vision on the larger tasks and projects.  I've since learned to timebox better and have learned to understand the goal is to learn to be an efficient developer and not just be able to churn out websites from memory. I have seen a lot more success in my static comps, and I feel like that is definitely my stronger point. I really enjoyed utilizing CSS to showcase my projects and I never minded doing that.

* After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?

* I do find it difficult to talk about myself to others due to my being in the military. I do not want to be stereotyped as something negative, because I see myself as someone who is willing to learn rather than anything else. I do realize it is important and definitely apart of my story, but it is still rather difficult. Two steps I can take are to practice telling my story more, and to try to be more comfortable in doing so because it is very important.
